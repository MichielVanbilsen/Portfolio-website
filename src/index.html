            <p>I studied Computer Science at PXL College in Hasselt, Belgium, specializing in full-stack development. It was during this degree that my interest in web development was sparked, and I have since honed my skills through various internships. I gained valuable experience during my internships at Bewire and Yappa, where I learned a great deal about the industry and was able to apply my knowledge in practical settings.</p>

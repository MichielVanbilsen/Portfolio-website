            "Hi, I'm Michiel, a passionate fullstack developer with a love for
            creating unique and creative web projects. With a focus on
            integrating 3D models and making them interactive, I aim to create
            immersive and engaging web experiences for users. Throughout my
            career, I've honed my skills in web development, programming, and
            design, and I pride myself on my ability to deliver high-quality
            projects that exceed expectations. I enjoy working collaboratively
            with clients to understand their needs and bring their ideas to
            life. Whether you're looking to showcase your business, tell a
            story, or create a new online experience, I'm excited to work with
            you and help you achieve your goals. Let's build something great
            together!"

              I studied Computer Science at PXL College in Hasselt, Belgium,
              specializing in full-stack development. It was during this degree
              that my interest in web development was sparked, and I have since
              honed my skills through various internships. I gained valuable
              experience during my internships at Bewire and Yappa, where I
              learned a great deal about the industry and was able to apply my
              knowledge in practical settings.
